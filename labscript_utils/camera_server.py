# This file implements the protocol for a camera server, that is, a program
# that BLACS can interface with to control cameras. It contains a class that
# acts as a camera server and communicates with BLACS over zeromq. The
# protocol is as below. A user need not implement this protocol themselves,
# they instead should subclass CameraServer and override the
# transition_to_buffered(), transition_to_static(), and abort() methods. An
# example is show at the bottom of this file. Note that the filepath send from
# BLACS to the camera server has a 'network agnostic' prefix - it is assumed
# that BLACS and the camera server may not have the same path to the location
# of the HDF5 file, it may be on a shared drive with different drive
# letters/mount points on the two computers. So BLACS calls
# labscript_utils.shared_drive.path_to_agnostic() on the filepath before
# sending it, and the camera server should call
# labscript_utils.shared_drive.path_to_local() once receiving it. If you
# subclass CameraServer, you don't have to worry about this step, so long as
# the shared drive path is correctly declared in your labconfig file.
#
# All communications are as utf-8 encoded strings.
#
# Ping, can occur at any time:
#   BLACS sends: 'hello'
#   CameraServer responds: 'hello'
#
# transition_to_buffered, occurs when BLACS is preparing to start a shot:
#   BLACS sends: '<utf8-encoded-path-of-h5-file->.h5'
#   CameraServer responds: 'ok'
#   BLACS sends: '' (empty string)
#   (Camera server calls self.transition_to_buffered(), to do any processing
#       it needs to to set up the shot)
#   CameraServer responds: 'done'
#   OR, if exception encountered calling self.transition_to_buffered(), camera
#       server calls self.abort() and then responds with the exception text.
#
# transition_to_static, occurs when BLACS has completed a shot:
#   BLACS sends: 'done'
#   CameraServer responds: 'ok'
#   BLACS sends: '' (empty string)
#   (Camera server calls self.transition_to_static(), to do any processing it
#       needs to do at the end of the shot)
#   CameraServer responds: 'done'
#   OR, if exception encountered calling self.transition_to_static(), camera
#       server calls self.abort() and then responds with the exception text.
#
# abort, can occur at any time:
#   BLACS sends 'abort'
#   (Camera server calls self.abort(), to return things to a sensible state
#       where transition_to_buffered can be called again )
#   CameraServer responds: 'done'
#   OR, if exception encountered calling self.abort(), camera server responds
#       with the exception text.
